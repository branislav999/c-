# Overview


As a software engineer, I am trying to further my learning by practicing skills I have been introduced to in the past, and want to build my confidence in fundamentals of programming languages, such as C++. The purpose is to deepen my understanding of the syntax in C++, particularly in handling memory management, pointers and so on.
